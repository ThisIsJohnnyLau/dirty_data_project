# Setup

## Loading libraries

```{r message=FALSE}

library(readr)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

```

## Loading cleaned data

```{r message=FALSE}

decathlon <-
here("clean_data/clean_data.rds") %>% 
    read_rds()
```

# Data
## Raw
```{r message=FALSE}

"raw_data/decathlon.rds" %>% 
    here() %>%
    read_rds() %>% 
    data.table()
```

## Clean data
```{r message=FALSE}
decathlon %>% 
    data.table()
```

# Questions

## Finding the longest long jump in the data
```{r}
decathlon %>%
    group_by(event) %>% 
    filter(event == "long_jump",
           event_points == max(event_points)) %>% 
    select(-ranking:-overall_competition_points)
```



## Finding the average 100m time for each competition
```{r message=FALSE}
decathlon %>% 
        filter(event == "100m_sprint") %>%
    group_by(competition) %>%
        summarise(average_100m_time = mean(event_points))
```

## Finding the competitor with the highest total points across both competitions
```{r}
decathlon %>% 
    group_by(competitor) %>%
    summarise(total_competition_points = sum(overall_competition_points)) %>% 
    filter(total_competition_points == max(total_competition_points)) %>% 
    head(3)
    
```


## Finding the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition
```{r}

decathlon %>% 
    select(-overall_competition_points, -ranking) %>% 
    filter(event == "shot_put")%>% 
    group_by(competition) %>%
    top_n(3, event_points) %>% 
    arrange(desc(event_points))

```


## Calculating the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those that ran 400m in more than 50 seconds
```{r}

decathlon %>% 
    filter(event == "400m_sprint")%>%
    group_by(event_points<50) %>% 
    summarise(average_points = mean(overall_competition_points))
```
