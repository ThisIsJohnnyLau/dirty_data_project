## Loading libraries and cleaned data
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#loading libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readr)

# loading in cleaned data
clean_cake_recipe <-
    here("clean_data/cake_recipes.csv") %>% 
    read_csv()
```

### Finding cake with the most Cocoa

```{r}
clean_cake_recipe %>% 
    filter(ingredient == "Cocoa") %>% 
    top_n(1, value)
    
```

### Finding number of cups of ingredients used in total for Sponge cake
```{r}
clean_cake_recipe %>% 
    filter(cake == "Sponge", measure == "cup") %>% 
    summarise(total_cups_ingredients = sum(value))
```

### Finding number of ingredients measured in teaspoons
```{r}
clean_cake_recipe %>% 
    filter(measure == "teaspoon") %>% 
    summarise(ingredients_with_tsp = n_distinct(ingredient))
```

### Finding cake with most the unique ingredients
```{r}
clean_cake_recipe %>%
  group_by(cake) %>%
  summarise(n_ingredients = n()) %>%
  top_n(1)
```


### Finding ingredients that are only used once
```{r}
clean_cake_recipe %>%
  group_by(ingredient) %>%
  summarise(n_cakes = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_cakes == 1)
```
